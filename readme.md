# A simple, local D&D stat tracker.

This was made for my own personal use, because i wanted to keep track of my dnd characters but all official apps required me to buy online resources which i either have physically or simply don't want to buy. This is why i created this. It's not meant to be pretty, but to simply work for my needs.
