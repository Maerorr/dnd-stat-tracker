# A simple, local D&D stat tracker.

This was made for my own personal use, because i wanted to keep track of my dnd characters but all official apps required me to buy online resources which i either have physically or simply don't want to buy. This is why i created this. It's not meant to be pretty, but to simply work for my needs.

TODO:
- [X] - character basic info (name, class, exp) + editable
- [X] - ability scores + editable
- [+/-] - saving throws and skill modifiers, proficiencies and expertise + editable
- [X] - hitpoints, AC, temporary hitpoints, hit dice etc. + editable
- [X] - money, including a converter
- [ ] - equipement as text
- [ ] - weapons and hit/dmg modifiers
- [ ] - spell list + spell slots
- [ ] - more spells as json files
- [ ] - local character saves
- [ ] - if im really into it, redesign most elements myself for the ui to not look stock

How it looks currently:
