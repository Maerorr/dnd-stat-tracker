Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics).\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.\n",

If the object is moved to over 10 feet from where the spell was spell casts, the glyph breeze and the spell expires without being triggered.\nThe glyph is virtually invisible and roll Intelligence (Investigation) against the fate of your save DC is required to find out.\nYou determine the shutter glyph while casting the spell. For the glyphs inscribed on a surface, the triggers are typically hit or stand on a glyph remove an object placed on the glyph, approach at a certain distance of the glyph or manipulate an object on which is inscribed the glyph. For the glyphs inscribed in an object, triggers are typically open the object, approaching at a distance from the object, seen or read the glyph. Once the glyph is triggered, the spell ends.\nYou can refine the trigger conditions so that the spell will work only in certain circumstances or in physical attributes (height or weight), the creature type (eg, only aberrations or the Dark Elves trigger the glyph) or alignment. You can also determine the conditions for certain creatures do not trigger the glyph, using a password, for example.\nWhen you sign the glyph, make a choice between the explosive runes or glyph fate.\n<b>Explosive runes.</b> When triggered, magical energy springs from the glyph in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere bypasses the corners. Each creature in the area must make a dexterity saving throw or it suffers 5d8 acid damage, lightning, fire, cold or thunder (to be determined during the creation of the glyph). If successful, the damage is halved.\n<b>Sort glyph.</b> You can store a level of 3 or less prepared spell in the glyph to chant during the creation of the glyph. The spell must target one creature or area. The stored spell has no immediate effect when spell casts that way. When the glyph is activated, the stored spell spell casts. If the spell is a target, it will target the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell invokes hostile creatures or creates sharp objects or traps, they also appear close as possible to the intruder and attack. If the spell requires concentration, it persists for the duration of the spell.\n",

You can question plants about events in the spell's area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature.\n",
